You can tell which version of opal is installed\nby running this command\n\n\n$ opal --version\n\n\n\nAt the start a new project, OPAL will bootstrap the initial project structure, including\na Djano project, some core datamodels (complete with JSON APIs) and a general application structure.\n\n\nFrom the commandline:\n\n\n$ opal startproject mynewapp\n\n\n\nThis will create a mynewap directory where your new project lives.\n\n\nLet's have a look at what that created for you:\n\n\nmynewapp/                   # Your project directory\n    LICENSE                 # A dummy LICENSE file\n    Procfile                # A procfile ready for deployment to e.g. Heroku\n    README.md\n    manage.py               # Django's manage.py script\n    requirements.txt        # Requirements file ready for your project\n\n    data/                   # A dummy directory for fixtures\n\n    mynewapp/               # The actual python package for your application\n         __init__.py\n        flow.py             # How patients move through your services\n        models.py           # Data models for your application\n        schema.py           # The list schemas for your application\n        settings.py         # Helpfully tweaked Django settings\n        tests.py            # Dummy unittests\n        urls.py             # Django Urlconf\n        wsgi.py\n\n        assets/             # Your static files directory\n        templates/          # Your template directory\n        migrations/         # Your Database migrations directory\n\n        opal.sqlite         # The Sqlite development database\n\n\n\nTest it out\n\n\nThe scaffolding step has generated you a working project - so let's check that out\n\n\ncd mynewapp\npython manage.py runserver\n\n\n\nIf you now visit \nhttp://localhost:8000\n in your browser, you should see the standard login screen:\n\n\n\n\nThe scaffolding step created you a superuser, so try logging in with the credentials:\n\n\n\n\nUsername: \nsuper\n\n\nPassword:  \nsuper1\n\n\n\n\nWhen you log in you should be presented with a welcome screen that shows you the three\nareas that are enabled by default - team lists, search and the admin area.\n\n\n\n\nOPAL applications are a collection of single page Angular apps that talk to the Django\nserver-side layer via JSON APIs. The Team Lists and Search options here are two examples of\nfront-end Angular single page apps.\n\n\nTeam lists\n\n\nMost clinical services will need at some stage to generate a list of patients - so OPAL provides\nthis functionality enabled by default.\n\n\nThe \nlist view\n is a spreadhseet-style list of patients - try navigating\nto the list view and adding a patient with the \nadd patient\n button.\n\n\n\n\nEach column contains a different type of information about a patient, while each\nrow represents one patient.\n\n\n\nStrictly speaking each row is an \nepisode\n\nof care for a patient - but we'll come to that in a second.\n\n\n\n\nThe columns you see initially are just a few of the standard clinical models that come with\nOPAL - for instance the Diagnosis model in your new application inherits from a model that\nlooks a lot like this:\n\n\nclass Diagnosis(EpisodeSubrecord):\n    condition         = ForeignKeyOrFreeText(Condition)\n    provisional       = models.BooleanField(default=False)\n    details           = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)\n    date_of_diagnosis = models.DateField(blank=True, null=True)\n\n    class Meta:\n        abstract = True\n\n\n\nLookup Lists\n\n\nYou will notice that the condition field has a custom field type - \nForeignKeyOrFreeText\n.\nThis is a custom field type that we use with OPAL when we want to use a\n\nLookup List\n.\n\n\nLookup Lists allow us to reference canonical lists of available terminology as a foreign key, while\nalso allowing synonymous terms, and a free text override. That means that we can ensure that\nwe record high quality coded data, while allowing users an easy way to enter unusual edge\ncases.\n\n\nYou'll need to import the data for a terminology before you can start to take advantage of that.\nFor now, let's use the reference data from elCID (An OPAL application maintained by Open Health Care):\n\n\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openhealthcare/elcid/master/data/lookuplists/lookuplists.json -P data/lookuplists\n\n\n\n\nBy convention, we store data in the \n./data/lookuplists\n directory of our project.\n\n\n\n\nNow let's import the data:\n\n\npython manage.py load_lookup_lists -f data/lookuplists/lookuplists.json\n\n\n\nNow refresh your application and try adding a new diagnosis to your patient. As you start to type in\nthe condition field, you'l see that the conditions we just imported appear as suggestions:\n\n\n\n\nAdd your own data models\n\n\nSo far we've begun to get a sense of the batteries-included parts of OPAL,\nbut before long, you're going to need to create models for your own needs.\n\n\nMost OPAL models are \nSubrecords\n - they relate to either a patient, or\nan episode (an episode is for example, an admission to hospital).\n\n\nLet's see how that works by creating a TODO list model that is assigned to\nepisodes of care. In your \nmynewapp/models.py\n :\n\n\nclass TODOItem(models.EpisodeSubrecord):\n    job       = fields.CharField(max_length=200)\n    due_date  = fields.DateField(blank=True, null=True)\n    details   = fields.TextField(blank=True, null=True)\n    completed = fields.BooleanField(default=False)\n\n\n\nThis is simply a Django model, apart from the parent class \nmodels.EpisodeSubrecord\n\nwhich provides us with some extra functionality:\n\n\n\n\nA relationship to an episode, linked to a patient\n\n\nJSON APIs for creating, retrieving and updating it\n\n\nEnsuring that the OPAL Angular layer knows it exists\n\n\n\n\nNext, we're going to let OPAL take care of the boilerplate that we'll need to use this\nmodel in our application. From the commandline:\n\n\n$ opal scaffold mynewapp\n\n\n\nLet's take a look at what that did:\n\n\n\n\nIt created a Django migration\n\n\nIt created a detail template \nmynewapp/templates/records/todo_item.html\n\n\nIt created a form template \nmynewapp/templates/modals/todo_item_modal.html\n\n\n\n\nDetail template\n\n\nThe default detail template simply displays each field on a new line:\n\n\nspan ng-show=\"item.job\"\n[[ item.job ]] \nbr /\n/span\n\n\nspan ng-show=\"item.due_date\"\n[[ item.due_date  | shortDate ]] \nbr /\n/span\n\n\nspan ng-show=\"item.details\"\n[[ item.details ]] \nbr /\n/span\n\n\nspan ng-show=\"item.completed\"\n[[ item.completed ]] \nbr /\n/span\n\n\n\n\nForm template\n\n\nThe default form template will display each field on a new line, with some basic\nappropriate form field types set.\nIt uses the OPAL form helpers templatetag library.\n\n\n{% extends 'modal_base.html' %}\n{% load forms %}\n{% block modal_body %}\n  \nform class=\"form-horizontal\"\n\n   {% input  label=\"Job\" model=\"editing.job\"  %}\n   {% datepicker  label=\"Due Date\" model=\"editing.due_date\"  %}\n   {% textarea  label=\"Details\" model=\"editing.details\"  %}\n   {% checkbox  label=\"Completed\" model=\"editing.completed\"  %}\n  \n/form\n\n{% endblock %}\n\n\n\nAdding TODOs to our Team Lists\n\n\nNow let's add our TODO list model as a column in the Spreadsheet-like list view.\n\n\nThe columns for team lists are set in \nmynewapp/schema.py\n as a list of models.\n\n\nOpen mynewapp/schemas.py and edit the \nlist_columns\n variable to add \nmodels.TODOItem\n as\nthe final item:\n\n\nlist_columns = [\n    models.Demographics,\n    models.Location,\n    models.Allergies,\n    models.Diagnosis,\n    models.PastMedicalHistory,\n    models.Treatment,\n    models.Investigation,\n    models.TODOItem\n]\n\n\n\nRefresh the lists page in your browser, and you'll see your new column on the end - add a\nTODO item, noting how we automatically get appropriate form types like datepickers and\ncheckboxes.\n\n\nYou can edit any entry in the list view by double clicking on it.\n\n\nTweaking the default scaffolding\n\n\nThe scaffolding templates are only really supposed to get you started - you'll often\nneed to tweak the templates they generate with whatever logic makes sense for your\napplication.\n\n\nFor us, you'll notice that the value of \nTODOItem.completed\n simply displays as false -\nwhich is not particularly useful. So let's update that using the OPAL\n\nBoxed filter\n. In \nmynewapp/templates/records/todo_item.html\n\nchange the last line to look like this:\n\n\nspan ng-show=\"item.completed\"\n[[ item.completed | boxed ]] \nbr /\n/span\n\n\n\n\nSet an Icon for your model\n\n\nYou'll notice that your new column is the only one without an icon - we set the icon by\nadding the following property to your \nTODOItem\n class:\n\n\n    _icon = 'fa fa-th-list'\n\n\n\nSome other batteries included\n\n\nLet's take a look at some of the other core functionality that we now have out of the box:\n\n\nSearch\n\n\nBy default, we also enable the search module, which allows you to search by patient name\nor unique identifier:\n\n\n\n\nDetail views\n\n\nWe also have a detail view for our patients, which you can access via search results. This\nview will typically allow for a more detailed display and editing of all the events\ncomprising an activity of care than is available on the list page.\n\n\n\n\nJSON APIs\n\n\nOPAL automatically creates self-documenting JSON APIs for your interacting with the data\nin your application. You can inspect these APIs interactively at the url:\n\n\nhttp://localhost:8000/api/v0.1/\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat next?\n\n\nThis is just a glimpse at the full range of functionality that comes with OPAL - there is\nmuch more to discover in the \nTopic Guides\n.",
